            <p>Sports have always been in my life. They help me relax in times of trouble and have become therapeutic
                to me. As a kid with lots of energy, I often played a lot of sports such as <em>basketball, soccer, track,
                and ping pong</em>. As my athletic abilities began to evolve throughout the years, I began to improve in sports
                like volleyball and rugby. Once I realized how much I enjoyed <strong>rugby and soccer</strong> I began
                to focus on those two sports and dedicated my time to them. I ended up being the <strong>captain</strong> 
                of both school teams and excelling in <strong>both</strong>. Now I play sports frequently throughout the week as it 
                helps me feel <em>relieved</em> and acts as a free therapy session.</p>

            <p> My academics were not as impressive as my athletics. 
                However, I managed to enjoy studying in high school and eventually raised my grades effectively. 
                Math is one of my favorite courses as well as physics. Sports did not only help me stay physcially
                but also helped keep my mental state intact as well as my grades. Physical activity helps you 
                concentrate significantly and allows your memory to improve over time. Having said this, I would study and 
                later play soccer or rugby; this became very affective as I began to understand the material more and do better on the exams</p>
